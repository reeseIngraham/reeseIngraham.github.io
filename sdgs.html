<div class = "disclaimer">
    Note: This current version of this piece is my final project for my undergraduate applied econometrics class. As
    such, it does not make a causal claim, only a correlational claim (or, in this case, a lack of correlation). I'm
    currently working on a revamped version of this paper that uses a difference-in-differences approach to make
    a causual claim.
