<div class = "disclaimer">
    Note: This current version of this piece is my final project for my undergraduate applied econometrics class. As
    such, it does not make a causal claim, only a correlational claim (or, in this case, a lack of correlation). I'm
    currently working on a revamped version of this paper that uses a difference-in-differences approach to make
    a causual claim.

    <p>This was my final project for my undergrad applied econometrics class. Controlling for various aggravating
    aspects of the crime as well as demographics of the victim, I find that crimes reported in a high-crime neighborhood in
    Los Angeles do not have more of a gap between occurrence and report than crimes reported in low-crime neighborhoods.</p>
