  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I was born in Modesto, CA, where I went to Modesto High School and graduated with my IB Diploma in 2016. At MoHi,
      I did high school mock trial, which sparked my current interest in the law.</p>
    <p>I'm currently at Occidental College, majoring in economics and minoring in mathematics and computer science. My
      focus is in applied microeconomics and microeconomic theory. To this end, I have taken classes like behavioral
      economics and game theory. I have also taken
      quantitative courses such as applied econometrics, data structures, and a proof-based discrete mathematics class.
        Next semester, I'm taking Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus, as well as Intro to
        Ethnomusicology, and the Tragic in Iranian Literature and Culture.
        In addition to microeconomics, I have a passion for open and transparent science, which is
        why I have posted all of my data and code from my various school projects online.</p>
    <p>
      Outside of the classroom, I'm the captain of the Oxy moot court team, which competes at regional tournaments in
        Long Beach and Fresno. In addition, I'm currently conducting research under Professor Edward Kammerer. For
        funzies, I compete in Kaggle data science and machine learning competitions. I also have my SCUBA diving license
        (PADI Open Water) and love to go diving! I'm also a (very bad) tennis player.</p>

    <p>I'm currently reading <i>The Chickenshit Club: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives</i> by
    Jesse Eisenger.</p>
