  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I was born in Modesto, CA, where I went to Modesto High School and graduated with my IB Diploma. At MoHi, I did
  high school mock trial, which sparked my interest in the law. I'm currently at Occidental College, majoring in
  economics and minoring in mathematics and computer science. At Oxy, I'm the captain of the moot court team, which
  competes at regional tournaments in Long Beach and Fresno. In addition, I'm currently conducting research under
      Professor Edward Kammerer, JD, PhD. In addition to my research, I compete in Kaggle data science and machine
      learning competitions. I also have my SCUBA diving license (PADI Open Water) and love to go diving!</p>
