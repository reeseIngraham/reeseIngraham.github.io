  <h3>Recent Updates</h3>
  <p>I'm currently conducting research under Professor Edward Kammerer, JD, PhD, where I am reading landmark
  LGBT rights Supreme Court cases, and coding them as either making a "pro-assimilationist" argument or "pro-liberation"
  argument, to use the lexicon from LGBT critical theory.</p>
