<p>B.A. in Economics at Occidental College, expected May 2020<br>
Minors in Mathematics and Computer Science<br>
<br>
Hello! My name is Reese Ingraham. I am a junior in college studying economics, mathematics, and computer science at Occidental College. I am particularly interested in studying the economics of crime and social relationships. If you need to reach me, please email reese.ingraham@gmail.com or ringraham@oxy.edu.
<br>
If you're interested in my projects. Snitches Don't Get Stitches was my final paper for my applied econometrics class, where I found that the per-capita crime of the neighborhood you live in does not have a negative impact on your crime reporting behavior. Trial Aversion was my final paper for my behavioral economics class, where I used a combination of the ultimatum game and Rubinstein bargaining to model plea bargaining behavior. Finally, Sushi Go was my coding project for my game theory class, where I modeled the card game Sushi Go in Java, and wrote about it.
