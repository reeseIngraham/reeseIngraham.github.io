  <p> Hello! My name is Reese, and I'm a junior at Occidental College studying economics. My long-term goal is to
  pursue a doctorate in econ. My current research interests focus on the economics of crime and social
  relationships.</p>

<p> I received a Ford grant from Occidental College to conduct economics of education research under Professor Kevin Williams, PhD. Our project is titled "Determinants and Outcomes of Peer Heterogeneity," and we hope to examine how the heterogeneity of a student's peer group along various aspects such as race, gender, socioeconomic background, geographic origin, student athlete status, etc. impacts that student's success in college, using several measures of success. Using R and Python, I collect and clean various education datasets, and then use social network analysis in Stata to estimate the effects.</p>
  <p>In Winter 2019, I conducted research under Professor Edward Kammerer, JD, PhD, where I read landmark
  LGBT rights Supreme Court cases, and coded them as either making a "pro-assimilationist" argument or "pro-liberation"
  argument, to use the lexicon from LGBT critical theory. The fruits of this research were presented by Prof. Kammerer in January 2019 in Austin, Texas at the annual meeting of the Southern Political Science Association in a session called "Assimilation or Liberation: Examining the Legal Rhetoric in Select LGBT Rights Cases in the United
States Supreme Court".</p>
